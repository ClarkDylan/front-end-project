A basic weather widget that allows the user to input their city and state and see the current days temperature and condition, or see a 5 day forecast with the average temp over that 5 days as well as the condition of each day.

Before searching, the user can select farenheit or celsius. However, the current state of this app only supports cities within the U.S. so celsius is not as commonly used. The feature however is still implemented.
